# OculusLeap

A project made at CalHacks that allows multiple people with Oculus Rifts
and Leap Motions to be able to interact in the same "room".
Uses JMonkeyEngine3 with the SpiderMonkey networking API.

MonkeyGameWithLeap contains the source code for the project. 

HelloWorldTutorial is simply the code from the "Hello, Physics" tutorial 
on the JMonkey website.
